THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED (BUT WILL BE)

Save yourself the laborious task of tilting your head slightly to the left and downwards by laser-etching port outlines on the top of your MacBook!

Please note, this involves shining an extremely powerful, potentially damaging laser at your $2,000 computer. Please, please, please, please be careful.
